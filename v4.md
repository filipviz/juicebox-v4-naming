# Juicebox v4 Naming Updates

1. **JBTokenStore**: Burn, mint, token, claimed/unclaimed, issue, transfer.

- `issueFor(...)` mints a claimable ERC-20 token. This should be disambiguated (e.g. `deployErc20For(...)`).
- All variables should use "token". All natspec descriptions should use "project token".
- Unclaimed -> Internal. Add "internal" to ambiguous names (e.g. `transferFrom(...)` -> `transferInternalTokenFrom(...)`).
- Claimed -> ERC-20. Use ERC-20 in function names and variables (`_preferErc20Tokens`). Add ERC-20 to ambiguous names (e.g. `PROJECT_ALREADY_HAS_TOKEN` -> `PROJECT_ALREADY_HAS_ERC20_TOKEN`).
- Minor nits (`setFor(...)` -> `setTokenFor(...)`).

2. **JBFundingCycleStore**: Funding cycle, configuration, scheduling, discount rate, funding cycle duration, weight, user properties, intrinsic properties, metadata, queued, configure, initialize funding cycle, base funding cycle, standby funding cycle, eligible funding cycle, mock funding cycle, derive, funding cycle number, approved/rejected, struct (in reference to the funding cycle).

- Funding cycle -> ruleset. Alternatives: epoch, cycle, round. Epoch is my favorite, and is used by Ethereum, Cardano, NEAR, and others.
- We must fix the timestamp <-> struct <-> number trilemma (each of these is sometimes referred to as "funding cycle"). Let's say we go with ruleset: use `rulesetTimestamp`, `rulesetData`, and `rulesetId`/`rulesetNumber`. In natspec: "Ruleset timestamp", "Ruleset data", and "Ruleset ID"/"Ruleset number". ALWAYS specify.
- Reconfigure -> Edit ruleset (e.g. `reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)` -> `editRulesetOf(...)`).
- Discount rate -> decay rate. Issuance reduction proved clunky.
- If we go with epoch, change duration to epoch length.
- Weight -> Issuance rate.
- The distinction between user properties and intrinsic properties might be confusing. How about intrinsic properties -> internally derived properties, user properties -> user provided properties.
- Init -> setLatestRulesetFor?
- Ballot -> approver.
- Base, eligible, standby, queued, and current cycle feel confusing. How about: base -> lastApproved, standby -> upcomingIfApproved, and eligible -> currentIfApproved, and queued -> upcoming (maybe currentlyUpcoming). Let me know if I'm misinterpreting the functionality here. Current is good!
- Mock -> simulated? Not too important.

3. **JBProjects**: project, metadata. 

No changes needed.

4. **JBSplitsStore**: splits.

- `set(...)` -> `setSplitsFor(...)`.
- `_includesLocked(...)` -> `_includesLockedSplits(...)`.
- Maybe rename contract to `JBSplitStore`.

5. **JBPrices**: Price feed, base currency, 

- `priceFor(...)` could be made clearer (like `currencyPriceForBase(...)`) but this might not be worth the change.
- `addFeedFor(...)` -> `addPriceFeedFor(...)`

6. **JBOperatorStore**: Operator, permission, operator store, operatable.

- Rename contract to `JBPermissionStore`.
- Operator can be confusing. Might be worth renaming "admin" (or "delegate", although this can be confusing given the term's use in governance schemes).
- `setOperator(...)` -> `setPermissionsForOperator(...)`.
- `setOperators(...)` -> `setPermissionsForOperators(...)`.
- Also consider renaming `JBOperatable` -> `JBPermissionModifiers`.

7. **JBDirectory**: Directory, primary terminal.

Maybe directory -> registry (and rename the contract to `JBRegistry` or `JBContractRegistry`). It feels slightly clearer.

8. **JBController**: Controller.

- Possibly controller -> manager or coordinator. It doesn't really "control" anything, it coordinates other contracts and manages the project lifecycle. That being said, controller is close enough and I would understand keeping it.
- `reservedTokenBalanceOf` -> `undistributedReservedTokenBalanceOf`
- Distinguish between funding cycle number, timestamp, and struct (like with `JBFundingCycleStore`).
- `totalOutstandingTokensOf(...)` feels confusing. The token store's `totalSupplyOf(...)` feels more like the "outstanding tokens", and this feels like the total supply. Will think about this some more.
- `launchProjectFor(...)` -> `createAndSetupProjectFor(...)`.
- `launchFundingCyclesFor(...)` -> `createFundingCycleFor(...)` (`createRulesetFor(...)`).
- Incorporate changes from `JBFundingCycleStore`
- Maybe `mintTokensOf(...)` -> `mintTokens(...)` (and same with `burnTokens(...)`)
- `_configure` -> e.g. `_configureRulesetOf(...)`
- Remove overflow allowance.
- `migrate(...)` -> `changeController(...)`

9. **JBFundAccessConstraintsStore**: fund access constraints store, distribution limit, overflow allowance.

- `setFor(...)` -> `setFundAccessConstraintsFor(...)`
- Distribution limit -> payout limit.
- Rename to `JBFundAccessConstraintStore`

10. **Payment Terminals**: Various contract names, pay, add to balance of, overflow, hold fees, process fees, refund held fees, base weight currency, 

Contract naming:

- Payment terminal -> payment processor. Consequently:
- `IJBPaymentTerminal` -> `IJBPayProcessor`
- `IJBRedemptionTerminal` -> `IJBRedeemProcessor`
- `IJBPayoutTerminal` -> `IJBPayoutProcessor`
- `IJBAllowanceTerminal` will be removed.
- `IJBSingleTokenPaymentTerminal` -> `IJBSingleTokenPayProcessor`
- `IJBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal` -> `IJBPayRedeemPayoutProcessor`
- `JBETHPaymentTerminal` -> `JBNativeFundProcessor`. The current name doesn't sufficiently distinguish from `IJBPaymentTerminal` (pay only) despite implementing `IJBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`.
- `JBERC20PaymentTerminal` -> `JBERC20FundProcessor`.

Other:

- `currentEthOverflowOf` -> `excessNativeTokensOf` OR `redeemableNativeTokenAmountOf`. I prefer `excessNativeTokensOf`.
- `migrate(...)` -> `changeTerminal(...)`
- `_baseWeightCurrency` -> `_pricingCurrency`?
- Refund held fees -> unlock held fees.
- Process fees -> collect held fees.

11. **JBToken**: Rename contract to `JBERC20Token`.

12. **JBChainlinkV3PriceFeed**

13. **JBETHERC20ProjectPayer/JBETHERC20ProjectPayerDeployer**

- Project payer feels vague, but the alternatives seem worse. Considering pay relay, fund forwarder, payment router.
- `setDefaultValues(...)` -> `setDefaultPayParameters(...)`.

14. **JBETHERC20SplitsPayer/JBETHERC20SplitsPayerDeployer**: Same as project payer.

15. **JBMigrationOperator** will (presumably) be removed.

16. **JBReconfigurationBufferBallot**: Ballot, state, reconfiguration buffer ballot, duration.

- Ballot -> approver (or e.g. ruleset approver).
- State -> Approval status. If this is too much, state is also good.
- Reconfiguration buffer ballot -> Deadline approver?

17. Other:

- Pay/redeem data source -> pay/redeem data provider. Still thinking about this one.
- Pay/redeem delegate -> pay/redeem callback.
